# password-code-generator
 A program who generates passwords/codes


## Getting Started

This project is sample to create randomly codes/password.

You can create passwords of different difficulties according to the difficulty you choose.

For example if you choose "Basic" level, you can create password only by lowercase and uppercase letters.
- It's like pODkR

If you choose "Medium" level, you can create password along with what the simple level brings, you also add numbers to the work.
- It's like x39kG

If you choose "Expert" level, it's combine of the previous two and special symbols. ( Note: Probably websites won't accept some of these symbols but they added to make password more complicated. It's just sample )
- It's like ^5X?m

Important note : Because of the logic, although you choose the most difficult option you can face with password/code like A90bM. It's maybe low possibility but it is possible. I Will try to fix it in next publish.
